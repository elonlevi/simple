This documentation describes how to use the Pavel robotic toothbrush.

Note that this toothbrush is totally safe to use for children, adults,or pets.

FYI my best friend and I were walking around the park smoozing about our kids and how we dread trying to hold them down to take the medicine from the peditrician,,I dont think any of the brilliant scientists at the Big drug companies have evr tasted the stuff that they create...My daughter actually goes into panic attack and starts trying to choke herself half a spoon goes down here throat and the rest is spit out all over my nightgown! She recommended Swallow Aid and it really works my daughter loves the cherry flavor and it helps her relax when mommy says those dreaded words ...Lets take your medicine before bed!!!

I read the recviews on Amazon ...some bad most good and then I decided to try it! I was thinking that this could be the best $13 dollar investment in my life if my daughter will stop the tantrums when it time to take the medicine!!
